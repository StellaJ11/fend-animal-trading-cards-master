			<p id="info">When puppies are born, they don't open their eyes or begin to hear until they're 9 to 12 days old. Since a lot of important development and growth happens for puppies during the first 3 weeks, they spend 90% of their time sleeping and need to eat five small portions of food a day. After 3 weeks old, they develop their senses of smell, hear and see and start exploring the world.</p>
